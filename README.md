# LxFrontend

Lx is a dictionary web app for language learners built around the creation of customized entries with detailed semantic data. Rather than importing from an existing dictionary, creating entries manually allows you to track the new words that you learn and better absorb the new information.

To run this project locally, you must first have set up the [backend](https://github.com/BattleMage0231/LxApi/). Install all npm dependencies and then run `npm run dev` to run Vite.
